## üßêAbout

Tally is an inventory tracking application with CRUD functionality. The Front-end was created with React, React Hook Form, and React Select. I used JSON server for the mock Back-end.
<br/>

- Add, edit, delete and update products from a list
- Several modals to control the user flow ensuring confirmation of changes
- Form error handling with minimal re-renders provided by React-Hook-Form
- Visually pleasing select drop down form menus provided by React-Select

<br/>

## ‚õèÔ∏èBuilt with

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Git VCS
- React-Hook-Form
- React-Select
- React-Spinners
- Figma

## üèÅGetting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open two terminal windows
3. `cd` into the project directory in one window
4. run `npm install` - in the project directory
5. run `npm start` - to start up the Front-end
6. `cd` into the project directory in the second terminal window
7. run `npm run server`- to start the development server
8. The app should be running on `http://localhost:3000/`in your browser
   <br/>

## üóìPlanning and challenges

I began planning by reviewing the API documentation provided by Fixer Currency. The purpose of the application was fairly straight forward, provide conversion rates based on a specific amount. This project didn't present many technical challenges regarding data retrieval. However, I was faced with stylistic challenges mostly in regards to adding images within the select input in a dynamic way. After reviewing React-Select documentation as well as other online resources I was able to find a solution. Throughout the project, I reviewed and refactored several parts of my code in order to minimize the size of certain components.
